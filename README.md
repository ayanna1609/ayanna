# Hey there! I'm Ayanna Bansal

> Turning coffee into code, and logic into impact.

Welcome to my GitHub corner — a space where code meets curiosity. I’m currently a **Software Developer Intern at Trident, exploring the magic of building real-world software while sharpening my problem-solving superpowers.

## What I Love to Build

- Fast & efficient algorithms with C++ (because time & space matter!)
- Clean, responsive websites that don’t just look good but work smart
- Anything that challenges logic, sparks creativity, and teaches something new

## Tech I'm Currently Playing With

- Languages: C++, JavaScript, HTML/CSS  
- DSA Playground: LeetCode, Codeforces, GFG  
- Web Stack: Node.js, Express, MySQL (and always adding more!)  
- Tools: VS Code, Git/GitHub, Postman, Linux  

## What You’ll Find Here

- My journey from "Hello World" to real-world development  
- Projects that reflect my growth in web dev & backend logic  
- A bunch of DSA solutions, neat, structured, and often optimized  
- Learning experiments and mini challenges I’ve taken up for fun

## Beyond the Screen

When I’m not debugging or building, I’m probably:
- Hitting the gym to debug my posture
- Vibing to some music (my favorite background compiler)
- Smashing it on the badminton court
